            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp;With the Worldstone destroyed, Sanctuary's role in the Eternal Conflict was forever changed. People largely forgot the horrors of an earlier age, and the town of New Tristram sprung up not far from where Diablo once dwelled beneath the earth.&nbsp;</span></div><div>But Deckard Cain hadn’t forgotten. He brought his adopted niece Leah to New Tristram, and continued to study the evil that had once crept from the cathedral. Cain was convinced that it was only a matter of time before doom would threaten Sanctuary again, and, for 20 years of relative safety, his warnings were easy to ignore… until a star fell from the heavens.
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;The star struck Tristram’s old cathedral, sending Cain plummeting into a crater and Leah rushing for help.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Stories of the fallen star attracted heroes from all
 over Sanctuary, including
</div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A roving barbarian, survivor of Arreat's destruction; 
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A vengeance-driven demon hunter; 
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A monk from the monasteries of Ivgorod;
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A witch doctor from the umbaru people, and
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A wizard from the island nation of Xiansai.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Each of these individuals demonstrated unparalleled abilities, reminiscent of the nephalem born to angels and demons long ago.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;The heroes answered Leah’s plea for help and found Cain, who had survived the impact, fighting for his life against skeletal abominations reanimated by the fallen star’s energies. Investigating the crater, they discovered that the fallen star was but a man, one with little recollection of his arrival in Sanctuary.
</div><div>There were few clues to the stranger's identity: an ominous portent he could barely remember (though he was certain of its importance), and his sword, which had shattered when he struck Sanctuary.
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;After two decades of expecting new horrors to befall Sanctuary, Cain identified the man’s plight as key to understanding the coming darkness, and tasked the nephalem with retrieving the sword pieces.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Although the heroes successfully retrieved the fragments, Maghda—a cultist of the Lesser Evil Belial—attempted to seize the shards and mortally wounded Cain before fleeing from Leah and the heroes. As his final act on Sanctuary, Cain repaired the sword, and passed away before the eyes of his grieving niece. Cain’s suffering was not entirely in vain: reunited with his weapon, the stranger revealed himself as the fallen angel Tyrael, who had sacrificed his divinity to warn humanity of the arrival of two demon lords.
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Lesser Evils who had once cast Diablo and his brothers out of the Burning Hells—Belial, the Lord of Lies, and Azmodan, the Lord of Sin—were loose on Sanctuary, resuming their war to dominate mankind.</div></div>
