As Aidan traveled through the Rogue Monastery, the base of operations for the order known as the Sisters of the Sightless Eye, Diablo’s possessing spirit conjured vicious demons who drove the monastery’s inhabitants from their home. Marius, an old vagrant who had taken refuge in the Monastery, found himself miraculously unharmed during the attacks.
</font></div><div><font color="#cccccc">
</font></div><div><font color="#cccccc">&nbsp; &nbsp;Unsure if the horrors he had witnessed were tricks of his opium-addled mind, Marius followed Aidan, whom he referred to as the “Dark Wanderer.”
</font></div><div><br></div><div><font color="#cccccc">&nbsp; &nbsp;A group of heroes, driven to expunge the darkness, gathered in a small encampment constructed by the surviving rogues. Among them:

</font></div><div><br></div><div><font color="#cccccc">&nbsp; &nbsp;After rescuing Deckard Cain from demonic imprisonment, the heroes cleansed the infested Monastery under his guidance, but they were too late to catch Aidan.
</font></div><div><font color="#cccccc">Accompanied by Marius, Aidan had traveled to an eastern tomb where the great Horadrim Tal Rasha once sacrificed himself, thrusting the Amber Soulstone into his chest to imprison Baal, Lord of Destruction.
</font></div><div><font color="#cccccc">&nbsp; &nbsp;Inside the tomb, the archangel Tyrael clashed with Aidan. Meanwhile, Baal managed to free himself by tricking Marius into removing the Amber Soulstone from Tal Rasha's withered body.
</font></div><div><font color="#cccccc">
</font></div><div><font color="#cccccc">Aidan and Baal overpowered Tyrael and imprisoned him within the tomb, but not before the archangel commanded a whimpering Marius to take a shard of Baal's soulstone into the Burning Hells and destroy it, an act which would banish the Lord of Destruction (or any Prime Evil) from Sanctuary. 
</font></div><div><font color="#cccccc">&nbsp; &nbsp;By the time the heroes arrived at the tomb, Marius and the Prime Evils had gone. The champions quickly liberated Tyrael, who urged them to follow Marius's path and ensure the success of his desperate venture.
</font></div><div><br></div><div><font color="#cccccc">&nbsp; &nbsp;Humanity’s heroes pursued Baal and Aidan towards Travincal, holy site of the Zakarum religion, where the Evils freed their brother Mephisto from his prison. United once again, the Primes put their plan to dominate humanity into action—Diablo cast off Aidan’s mortal flesh and traveled through a portal to rally Hell’s legions, while Mephisto remained on Sanctuary to ensure none interfered with his brother.
</font></div><div><font color="#cccccc">
</font></div><div><font color="#cccccc">&nbsp; &nbsp;When the heroes arrived in Travincal, they were forced to battle not only Mephisto but also the corrupted luminaries of Zakarum. After a vicious confrontation that rattled the very stones of Mephisto's lair, humanity's champions cast down the Lord of Hatred and carried his soulstone through the portal to Hell.
</font></div><div><br></div><div><font color="#cccccc">&nbsp; &nbsp;Deep inside the Hells, the heroes shattered Mephisto’s soulstone upon the Anvil of Annihilation—then tracked Diablo to an unholy cathedral scored by ages of lava and rivers of blood. It was on this battleground that the heroes clashed with the Lord of Terror, pitting all of their valor and might against his timeless malevolence. At long last, Diablo was bested, his Crimson Soulstone sundered in the heart of Hell.
</font></div><div><font color="#cccccc">
</font></div><div><font color="#cccccc">&nbsp; &nbsp;Meanwhile, Baal had traveled north on a mission to corrupt the Worldstone, turning all mankind to the side of evil. First, the Lord of Destruction plotted to avoid the fates of his brothers. He tracked down Marius, who—gripped with fear and unable to destroy the Amber Soulstone—had sought refuge in an asylum. Disguised, Baal fooled Marius into giving up the soulstone… then cruelly ended his life.</font></div></div>
