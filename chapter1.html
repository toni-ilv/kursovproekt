            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;From the moment of reality’s creation, the angelic legions of the High Heavens and the demonic hordes of the Burning Hells waged an unending war known as the Eternal Conflict. After eons of battle, individuals from both armies grew weary of fighting and sought out a new home where they could co-exist peacefully.
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Using the powers of a massive artifact called the Worldstone, they created Sanctuary, a realm hidden from both the Heavens and the Hells.&nbsp;</span></div><div>The demons and angels dwelling on Sanctuary came to mate with each other, spawning powerful hybrids known as nephalem - the first generation of humans. In time, the angels grew fearful of nephalem potential, and tuned the Worldstone to limit their offspring's power. Slowly, over generations, humanity forgot the secrets locked away in its blood.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Ultimately, the Heavens and the Hells learned of Sanctuary's existence, and clashed across the world in the horrific Sin War. After the fighting was brought to a standstill, both sides agreed to cease their battles on Sanctuary, leaving mankind to its fate. Yet, Diablo, Mephisto, and Baal—the Prime Evils and leaders of the Burning Hells—plotted to use humans as tools of war.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;This goal bred dissent among lesser demons, who revolted. Hell's legions were devastated, but they'd exiled the Prime Evils to Sanctuary. The archangel Tyrael, one of Heaven's leaders, noticed the Evils in the human world and covertly formed the Horadrim, a group of magi, to hunt the Primes. Armed with soulstones—relics that could contain the Primes' essences—the Horadrim imprisoned their quarry, and hid the souls of the Three throughout Sanctuary.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Over two centuries passed without machinations from the Prime Evils, until the human king Leoric chose Tristram for his domain. Unbeknownst to Leoric, a malevolent presence lurked beneath the tiny town: the imprisoned Lord of Terror, Diablo.
</div><div>
</div><div>Eventually, the confines of his Crimson Soulstone weakened, and Diablo was able to reach into the minds of the townsfolk above. Under the demon’s influence, one of Leoric’s aides—the Archbishop Lazarus—released Diablo.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;With his true master freed, Lazarus endeavored to bend the king to demonic ends. He whispered to Leoric of an imaginary threat from the nearby country of Westmarch, leading the monarch to dispatch his eldest son, the warrior Prince Aidan, with an army.
</div><div>
</div><div>Lazarus then abducted the distracted king’s youngest son, Prince Albrecht, so that Diablo could possess the child and regain physical form.
</div><div>
</div><div>As Diablo drank in the child’s terror, the evil beneath Tristram began to spread throughout the town.</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Aidan returned, vowing to rescue his brother and cleanse Tristram. Adventurers from all over the world were drawn to Aidan’s quest, including a rogue from the Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye, a Vizjerei sorcerer from Kehjistan, and a number of other resilient warriors trained in an array of weapons and armor.
</div><div>
</div><div>The heroes were aided by several of Tristram’s surviving villagers: Griswold the Blacksmith forged and repaired the party’s equipment; Adria the Witch provided them with magical books and potions. Deckard Cain, the last living Horadrim, used his knowledge to guide their mission.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Lazarus was slain beneath Tristram, and Aidan challenged Diablo, who had possessed Albrecht’s body, twisting it into a harrowing monstrosity. Aidan destroyed Diablo’s manifestation… but he could not destroy the Crimson Soulstone. Fearing that Diablo would remain free to corrupt more innocents, Aidan resolved to contain the demon—by plunging the soulstone into his own forehead.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Weary, Aidan returned to Tristram, but the town’s celebrations did nothing to calm the dark essence that haunted his mind. The prince soon departed, heading to the east in search of answers… and salvation.
