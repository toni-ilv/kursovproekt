<span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp;After Diablo was defeated and trapped in the Black Soulstone, the Angiris Council resolved to secure it within the High Heavens, but Tyrael doubted this solution. He recruited powerful humans from all over Sanctuary and dubbed them the new Horadrim, the first since the death of Cain. With their help, Tyrael stole the Black Soulstone from the High Heavens and planned to conceal it beneath the ruined city of Corvus.&nbsp;</span></div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Meanwhile, an ancient presence contemplated Tyrael’s undertaking. Malthael, the former </div><div>Archangel of Wisdom, had become tormented by the mysteries of creation. He had abandoned his brethren and, in his search for the nature of souls, had become the Aspect of Death.
</div><div>

</div><div>After the nephalem defeated the Prime Evil, Malthael decided to exterminate all beings of demonic heritage—including humanity—to end the Eternal Conflict. He attacked the new Horadrim and seized the Black Soulstone. His army of Reapers, a terrifying host of angels and undead, began to slaughter the people of nearby Westmarch and harvest scores of souls. With each human soul collected, Malthael’s power increased.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Malthael spirited the Black Soulstone to another realm: the Pandemonium Fortress, front line of the Eternal Conflict. Here, Malthael would reshape the Soulstone to consume all demonic essence in Sanctuary.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;With the help of a crusader of the Zakarum faith, the nephalem confronted Malthael. In combat, Malthael shattered the Black Soulstone and devoured the released soul of the Prime Evil, devastating the battlefield with the powers of Hell and Death. After a grueling conflict, the combined might of the nephalem overcame the Aspect of Death. Malthael vanished in a blast of energy, releasing all the souls he had consumed—including Diablo.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;… And Tyrael wondered if his nephalem allies, who had now bested champions of both Heavens and Hells, would one day fall to the same corruption that brought low even the greatest of Archangels.
