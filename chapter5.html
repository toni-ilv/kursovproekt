            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Together with the nephalem, Leah and Tyrael pursued Maghda to the desert city of Caldeum. They cornered Maghda within demon-infested Alcarnus, where they finally avenged Cain’s death—but the heroes learned a dark truth from the witch before she breathed her last.&nbsp;</span><br></div><div>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Her master, Belial, the Lord of Lies, was hidden deep within Caldeum, manipulating its people from the shadows. Tyrael and Leah searched the city sewers for evidence of the demon lord, but only found Belial’s minions and their captive: Adria, Leah’s long-lost mother, the same witch who once provided assistance to Aidan and his companions in their fight against Diablo.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Conflict with the forces of evil had forced Adria into hiding years ago, and she had reluctantly left Leah behind. Both women were grateful for their reunion, but Adria quickly revealed the gravity of her presence in Caldeum. Belial's minions had captured her in search of the Black Soulstone, an artifact which could trap the souls of the Prime and Lesser Evils, banishing them from Sanctuary.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The artificer of the Black Soulstone, a Horadrim traitor known as Zoltun Kulle, was the only one who knew of its location, and he had been dead for centuries. Using Leah's magic, the party summoned a shade of the mad wizard and struck a bargain: Kulle would share the path to his buried magical archives and the soulstone within… in exchange for his resurrection.
</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Once Kulle was restored to life at the heart of his lair, he summoned forth the Black Soulstone, but was surprised to see the crystal humming with the souls of five of the seven Evils. Over twenty years, Adria had carefully marked the essences of the five demon lords so that they would become trapped in the stone.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Suspicious of the witch and her intentions, Kulle offered the nephalem a deal: work with him to cast down the Heavens and Hells, and reign together over Sanctuary. The heroes rejected the proposal, and were forced to contend with Kulle’s forbidden magic.
</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp;With the Black Soulstone in their grasp, the nephalem returned to Caldeum to imprison Belial… only to find the city besieged by his forces. Acting swiftly, the heroes forced their way into the imperial palace and unmasked Belial, who had disguised himself as Hakan II, child Emperor of Caldeum.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp;In his fury, the Lord of Lies nearly tore the imperial palace apart, and the nephalem along with it—yet the heroes overpowered Belial and trapped his soul within the Black Soulstone.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">With peace restored to Caldeum, the nephalem prepared to hunt for Azmodan, but Leah had already received a mocking vision from the Lord of Sin.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Boasting about his knowledge of the Soulstone, Azmodan exulted, for his entire hellish host had begun invading Sanctuary from Arreat Crater.
