            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Armed with the Amber Soulstone he’d plucked from Marius’s dead hands, Baal personally led an assault upon the northern lands of Arreat, site of a great mountain sacred to the mighty barbarian tribes. His goal was the mountain itself: the resting place of the Worldstone used to forge Sanctuary.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Baal’s hordes ravaged the north, destroying each barbarian fortress save the small town of Harrogath, where several mystic Elders sacrificed themselves to weave a protective spell around their home.
</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Nihlathak, the town’s only surviving Elder, doubted the potency of their spell, and so he struck a bargain with the Lord of Destruction.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The demonic army would spare the people of Harrogath in exchange for the Relic of the Ancients, an artifact which would allow Baal to enter Mount Arreat unchallenged by its spectral guardians.
</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The heroes who defeated Diablo pursued Baal to the north, where they were joined by two newcomers. One was an assassin of the Viz-Jaq’taar, an order created to hunt down renegade sorcerers. The other, a druid from the woodlands of Scosglen, commanded the forces of nature and wore the forms of beasts.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp;With Tyrael’s aid, the band of heroes fought their way through the devastated northern wilds, breaching the vanguards of Baal’s army to reach Harrogath.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">In town, the heroes uncovered Nihlathak’s gambit, bested the traitorous Elder and raced for the summit of Mount Arreat, only to find that Baal had already moved into the mountain’s heart. Before they could give chase, they were forced to squander precious time defeating Arreat’s guardian Ancients while Baal began his malefic work within the Worldstone chamber.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Inside, the heroes confronted the Lord of Destruction, and vanquished him in a ferocious battle. Though he fell before their blades and invocations, Baal had already corrupted the Worldstone, an act that threatened to spread strife throughout Sanctuary.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The archangel Tyrael took decisive action to save humanity. He hurled his angelic sword, El’druin, into the Worldstone, destroying the object that created Sanctuary. The surrounding land—including nearby barbarian settlements—was annihilated in a catastrophic explosion, and the mortal world was exposed to the gaze of the Heavens and Hells.&nbsp;</span></div></div>
